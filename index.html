                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the "IT Practices User Manual". This manual is part of the Global IT Community. </p>
                    <p>If you are reading a printed version, you can find the latest version online at <a href="http://usermanual.itpractices.org">http://usermanual.itpractices.org</a>. This version was taken from the website at:</p>
                    <div id="dateDiv" style="font-weight: bold"></div><p></p>

                    
                    <p>The tools, processes and other artefacts that make up "How the community works" are all driven by the community itself via a Continuous Improvement process. We are certainly drinking our own champagne!</p>
                    <p>Suggestions for improvements to "How the community works", this manual or any other improvement for that matter can be submitted in the <a href="http://progress.itpractices.org">Progress Tracking</a> tool. More information about this tool can be found <a class="onpage" href="#ProgressTracking">below</a></p>                    

                    <h2>What this manual is for</h2>
                    <p>This manual helps you find your way within the eco system of the IT Practices Community. It explains how the various systems integrate and how to use each.</p>
                    <p>If you are just getting involved in the community and just want to find out the basics you are able to glans over the topics and get the gist of what the community is about and why it's absolutely awesome! </p>
                    <p>The natural progression is to become an active member after a while and to start contributing to certain topics. That would be a good point in time to re-read this manual to understand in more detail what the processes are and what the expectations are in each contribution stage. We have found that this considerably improves the efficiency.</p>
                    <p>When you have tasted the easy and agility of making process improvements that this PII gives you, you will inevitably want to implement either the practices agreed in the community and/or the PII itself. That is also covert in this manual, even though it is only on a high level. The reason is that adopting these generic practices and transform them into Best Practices for you professional environment takes specific action plans.</p>
                    <p>Sparkling IT specialises in Implementing Best Practices and a Continuous Improvement Culture. More information can be found on our website.</p>

                    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
                    <p>Even though everyone should be able to read this document, the audience targeted in this manual are people who have significant experience in multiple IT disciplines. We will therefor make some assumptions about existing knowledge. The following table articulates these knowledge areas and where to find more information if need be.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>The typical one-liner used to explain the community is: "To collaboratively create a WikiPedia for IT Practices", called the "IT Practices Library".</p>
                    <p>In more detail the vision of the entire community is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine best practices and recommendations for IT processes, practices and tools.</li>
                        <li>Provide working examples and artifacts to implement the recommendations.</li>
                        <li>Create a crowd-sourced1) community.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Allowing the broad discovery and leverage many experts' real life experience.</li>
                                <li>Validation of content by the global community.</li>
                                <li>Ability to maintain a large volume of content by utilizing many participants.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>To be a delegated authority for IT Best Practices for as many organisations as possible in the IT Industry.</li>
                        <li>Providing foundation for the rapid adoption of IT Best Practices within participating companies.</li>
                        <li>Allow participating organisations to contribute back to the community for wider adoption.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br />
                    <p>Imagine 6 organisations that each have some areas of high maturity and other areas where they could improve:</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/Ferris Wheel.jpg" />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>We bring organisations together to enable sharing and improving of each other. It's very obvious from the diagram above that each organisation contribute one piece of information, but gains 6. A 600% time saving for everyone!</p>
                    <p>Now imagine the same with thousants of participants...</p>

                    <h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
                    <p>
                        You will learn the Best IT Practices that will help you be more efficient in your role, what IT Best Practices would help your organisation as a whole be
                        more efficient and increase consistency. It will also open the doors for you to become a thought leader in the industry and allow you to set directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How? Well... What we are talking about is you gaining Tacit Knowledge of these IT Best Practices and being able to apply them. Gaining Tacit Knowledge is a
                        complicated way of saying "Learning". People Learn in a couple of ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tacit to Tacit</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tacit to Tacit knowledge transfer usually happens verbally, where one person knows stuff and explains it verbally to others. This happens during
                                presentations. Slides may be used, but presentations are primarily Tacit-to-Tacit.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Explicit to Tacit</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading a book or a WikiPedia page are examples of learning from explicit knowledge (Captured somewhere, paper in this case). The knowledge is captured
                                somewhere and is made available for everyone to absorb.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Personal Experience</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We all learn from Personal Experiences on a daily basis. In the professional sense, this means "Learning on the Job". This area is out of scope for the
                                community.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Why is this important?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, each approach has its pro's and con's. Tacit-to-Tacit has the benefit of being able to tailor the communication for the audience, but its labour
                        intensive and it therefore scales poorly. Explicit to Tacit has the downside of ambiguity while creating it and when learning from it and the content needs
                        to be maintained in order to remain fresh.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Global IT Community uses the best of both ways of learning. Furthermore, it acknowledges shortcomings and risks and has implemented practices to
                        mitigate risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monthly meetings in various cities across the globe help with the initial Tacit-to-Tacit knowledge. We capture the conversations as accurately as we can
                        and transform that into explicit knowledge for everyone to use (IT Practices Library). Please note that we not only summarize the outcomes, but also and
                        probably more importantly also the conversation leading up the decisions. We Capture the WHY behind the IT Practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This explicit knowledge provides us with a common language that then help us with the Tacit-to-Tacit knowledge transfer.
                    </p>                    


                    <h2>"IT Practices" versus "IT Best Practices"</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may have realised that we make a distinction between "IT Practices" and "IT Best Practices".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference is that the context matters when applying "IT Practices". Therefore, creating a single library that articulates "IT Best Practices" would
                        not be right. We have created a library that gives you all the facts you need to determine your "IT Best Practices", given the context that you will be
                        using them in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you accept that the Pareto Principle (80-20 rule) also applies, than most of the content should also be a best practice for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that, determining what Generic IT Practices are IT Best Practices for you does require in depth knowledge and experience. Sparkling IT, Founder
                        of the Global IT Community has over a decade of experience in implementing process improvements based on IT Best Practices and is able to help you
                        determine these in record time.

                    <h2>Not another standards library!!</h2>
                    <p>
                        You might be thinking: 'Not another one...' and you would be right. We feel the same way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Global IT Practices Communities approach has some fundamental differences compared to traditional frameworks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Crowd sourced, therefore more detailed guidance and fresh content.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similar to Wikipedia, which is also maintained by a large group of users, we believe the amount of content we can maintain is highly correlated to the
                                number of people participating. More people equals more detailed guidance. Traditional frameworks won't articulate "how" you should implement the
                                practices. This community takes the next step to do exactly that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Combining a crowd sourcing approach with a focus on revising existing content on a regular basis keeps it fresh. No more stale standards!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A technology platform that enables efficient sharing of IT Practices and improve collaboration on improvements.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Utilising recently introduced technology allows us to easily share content across organisations. The platform allows for individual customisations while
                                still receiving updates from the Global Community.
                            </p>

                                Install an on-premise instance with organisation-specific customisations. Participating organisations will continue to receive updates for the
                                non-customised content.
                            </p>

                                Frameworks like ITIL, CMMI, TOGAF, BABOK, etc. already have great content, the IT Practices Library will simply utilise them.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                We don't like paying for stuff that should just be freely available for everyone. However, not everyone thinks like us and charge organisation license fees
                                for the use of their libraries. In this case you already own it!
                            </p>

                    <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The community consist of many groups and in order to make everyone collaborate efficiently, a hierarchy has emerged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most visible level is the "City" level as that's the level where the physical, public meetings happen. All companies are invited to join and
                        participate in the Monthly Afternoon meetings as well as attending the evening presentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A city community has multiple sub-groups, each with their own special interest. Topics like "Development", "Testing", "Methods", "Procurement",
                        "Configuration Management", etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each sub-group also elects a lead and a delegate. The lead (or the delegate) participate in an overarching forum called the SEPG. The purpose of this
                        overarching group is to formally approve changes to the <a href="http://www.itpractices.org">Body of Guidance</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One can imagine that a need exists for communication across cities. And one is correct! The leads of the city SEPG collaborate in the country SEPG. And one
                        level further up, the country SEPG leads get together in the Global SEPG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Until now, we've only spoken about the hierarchy up. But there is also communities feeding into the City communities. And those communities are within
                        organisations. Ideally, organisations would allow internal communities determine how employees in the organisation should work. That model work
                        particularly well in combination with the Global IT Practices Community as it prevents re-invention of wheel and a constant flow of fresh, community
                        approves content. No more stale standards!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The following diagram shows how the various communities relate:
                    </p>

                    <div class="Waiting_for_community_input"></div>

                    <h2>Meetings</h2>
                    <p>
                        The city communities meet on a monthly basis. It's recommended to choose a time of month and a place and keep it consistent. I.e. Every first Wednesday of
                        the month, in the oval room of the White House. This makes it easier for people to remember of starts to build up a rhythm.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Membership</h2>
                    <p>
                        Participation is free and open for everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this doesn't mean there are no expectations on participating organisations. For the community to work we expect the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Respect the relevant <a href="http://www.itpractices.org/Live/contribute/charters">IT Practices Community Charters</a></li>
                        <li>Provide personal or organizational topics in the lead up to the meeting</li>
                        <li>Attend the community meetings and share your personal or organizational experiences.</li>
                        <li>Execute action items you volunteered for</li>
                        <li>Champion the adoption of the agreed IT Practices within your organization</li>
                        <li>At this stage, we exclude software vendors as regular members from the community as that might impact the perception of objectivity of the forum in regards
                        to discussions about tools.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Joining the community</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome! To join all you need to do is click on "Join" on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Global-IT-Practices">Global IT Practices Meetup</a>, fill
                        in the form and submit! Too easy�
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to <a href="http://progress.itpractices.org">suggest topics</a>, however we suggest you first attend a meeting to experience the vibe and to get a feel for the level
                        and type of conversations. That will also give you a chance to talk to the community lead in person and to discuss the best approach to become an active
                        member and how to champion the adoption of the IT Practices in your organisation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Suggest topics for discussion</h2>
                    <p>
                        You the participant choose the format and topics we will be discussing in the meetings. We match questions from organisations to answers that already exist
                        in other organisations and that these other organisations are happy to share.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three ways to suggest topics.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            1. Open up the <a href="http://progress.itpractices.org">progress tracking tool</a> in the browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Go to the <a href="http://www.itpractices.org">IT Practices library</a> and in the bottom right corner you will find the option called <a>Improvement Proposal</a>.
                            This will open a form that allows you to specify some details of the topic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3. Email the city community lead and he/she will take care of it for you. This approach does put you in debt with that particular person for a beverage of
                            his/her choice.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Once the topic is in the system, all participants can place votes on the topics and thereby indicating that you want to have this topic discussed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The City Community lead will, in the lead up to the meeting, create the agenda for the meeting. He/she will not only take into consideration the votes, but
                        also a fair distribution of benefits across the participating organisations. This way long term participation is encouraged.

                    <h4>Collaboration tools</h4>
                    <p>To support the community in their collaboration efforts, a BuddyPress instance has been created. It allows users to leave messages, share knowledge, etc. All communication is captured so the WHY behind our decissions is captured future reference.</p>

                    <p>
	                    If we were to pick THE ONE argument why this library is much better than any corporate one, is because the crowd sourcing approach that drives this
	                    initiative. Because many people are using, reviewing, correcting the content, a much higher quality can be achieved than most organisations would be
	                    capable of. By so many eyes looking at the content, the guidance remains current, which is vital for determining "IT Best Practices". In the fast paced
	                    world of IT it's crucial for the user needs to be able to trust the information is up-to-date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Furthermore, the crowdsourcing also allows for guidance down to a much deeper level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Imagine this: Michael is Capability Uplift Manager for the Technology department of a financial institution. The Technology department has 400 people,
	                    providing IT services to 5200 Bankers. A fairly large IT department supporting a wealthy business. Out of his 400 people, how much FTE can he allow for
	                    process improvements? Let's go overboard and make it 10%, which means 40 FTE. Keeping up with the latest technology trends, evaluating practices and publishing
	                    internal guidance across the entire range of IT areas (Analysis, Architecture and Design, Build, Test, Deploy, Infrastructure, Operations, Project
	                    Management, etc) is a lot of work even for 40 FTE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Now let's have a look at WikiPedia, which success relied on crowd sourcing and were one of the first to utilise it on that grand scale. Millions of people
	                    are now debating and updating even more pages each month. They might spend a small bit of their time in contrast to FTE, however, 30 minutes times a
	                    Million equates to much more available effort. (12.500FTE)
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    With 40 FTE organisations are able to either spread its guidance across a wide variety of topics but only scratch the surface, or provide detailed guidance
	                    which then has to be focussed on a particular topic. This is noticeable with many of the traditional frameworks like CMMI, ITIL, etc. The frameworks
	                    articulate WHAT to do, but not HOW to do it. As that requires too many resources to achieve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    <Strong>By applying crowdsourcing means we can take of the entire breath of the IT Industry and provide detailed guidance.</Strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    And we haven't even mentioned the best yet:
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    It is the detailed guidance that will deliver Return on Investment to the organisations shareholders. Using this library can Jump start organisational
	                    Process Improvement activities and achieve far quicker results than the 2 1/2 years per CMMI level traditional frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    After implementing it behind the corporate firewall, the only thing organisations have to do is determine which of the practices out of the entire library
                    are IT Best Practices, which are not applicable and the ones that need customisation. More information about	<a href="http://todo">IT Practices vs IT Best Practices</a> can be found here.

	                    specialises in assisting organisations to cherry-pick from the IT Practices Library while ensuring high adoption rates from practitioners. Traditional
	                    approaches often miss the mark as well thought through processes, standards and procedures fall by the wayside as they lack adoption and don't deliver to

	                    The <a href="http://www.itpractices.com.au">Body of Guidance</a> is build using Technology called a Wiki which we'll talk about next.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is a wiki?</h2>
                    <p>
	                    A Wiki is a website that allows everyone to edit its content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Yeah... Assuming you're new to Wiki's, we'll let that one sink in
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    ...
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Yeah, everyone, not just the owner of the website or its employees
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    ...
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Cool aye?
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Imagine going to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> homepage and finding an "Edit" button on their home page. Now assume there is
	                    content on that page that you would think needs improving, you can do that right there and then. Just hit the "Edit" button and start typing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Depending on the configuration of the Wiki, the content might go live straight away or your change could start an approval process. In case of Microsoft, I
	                    imagine they would go for the second option. J
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Apparently when you explain what a wiki is you have to mention that it's a Hawaiian word, meaning "Quick". Done, ticked that box J
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    The idea of publishing content straight away might seem strange. What about deliberate wrongdoing?
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Interestingly, that hardly ever happens and the system is pretty resilient. High profile wikis often have a vibrant community that tends to fix issue
	                    before anyone even notices. I believe the average time for Wikipedia is well below the hour. So, crooks and villains have lost interest.

                    <h2>Why DokuWiki?</h2>
                    <p>
	                    although its in the top 5 of wiki's, DokuWiki isn't the best wiki, so why don't you the number one? The reason for choosing DokuWiki is a pretty
	                    technical one. I'll keep it on a high level first, before drilling into the technical details. Feel free to tune out any time. I'll include an increasing
	                    amount of geek jokes as the amount of readers diminishes and the reader's geekness increases. J
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    DokuWiki stores the wiki content as files. This in itself isn't a great feature, but it becomes a big benefit when storing those files something called a
	                    "Distributed Version Control system" like GIT.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Because all of a sudden a very familiar collaboration pattern emerges which has already delivered great technology enhancements. The pattern that we are
	                    talking about is what developers around the world do on a daily basis and how open source communities work that have delivered fantastic products like
	                    Linux, The Apache Webserver, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    The wiki content is checked into GIT and published on Github.com as a public repository. This means that everyone can fork and improve their instance of
	                    the IT Practices Library. The Wiki content is the equivalent of source code, DokuWiki is the equivalent of the IDE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    So, whenever we need to find the right process to collaborate within the IT Practices Community, we simply look at what do the Apache folks do?
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Since the decision to use DokuWiki as the Technology, we've published several extensions to tailer the wiki to what we are trying to do. All of which are
	                    freely available of course and some extend the functionality even further by offering a Professional Version.

                    <h2>Initiative Workspaces</h2>
                    <p>
	                    An important difference between normal wiki's and how the IT Practices Community works is that organisations can install a local instance of the standards
	                    library. Those organisations can than cherry pick out of the updates made by the IT Practices Community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    In order for this cherry-picking to work, a couple of things have to happen:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
	                        Content updates need to submitted as a set of changes, potentially spanning across multiple pages, maintaining consistent guidance to the end user.
                        </li>
                        <li>
	                    Documentation needs to accompany the updates so that the organisations can make informed decisions what to keep and what to skip.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
	                    Fortunately, these requirements are also applicable for the work done by to a specific role in the IT Industry. Any ideas? Developers do this all the time!
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    When developing a new feature, the old and the added code has to be error free in order to be compiled into executable files. In major open source project,
	                    it vital to provide accurate documentation of changes so that derived distributions understand the impacts when adopting upstream changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Following this paradigm, the approach we are taking is derived from the apache open source project. In order to write content, every improvement is
	                    provided its own "Branch" or what we call an "Initiative Workspace".
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    A workspace is an exact copy of the content that is "Live". The administrators can give access to certain users to edit the content. When all the changes
	                    are done, the contributors can submit the changes for approval by their peers. After approval, the administrators can push the changes to Live.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Merging content</h2>
                    <p>
	                    With many improvements on the go at the same time, initiatives will get approved while others are still in progress. How does that concurrency work?
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    Well&#8230; Thanks for asking!
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    If other changes get approved, all the in-flight workspaces will see a notification asking to "Merge upstream changes". That notification contains a link
	                    that will display the page to allow administrators to merge the approved content into the local workspace. The "Merge Upstream" page shows all the various
	                    changes and the documentation describing the changes and potential impacts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    When merging, all upstream changes are merged into your workspace. Simple merges happen automatically, only when there are conflicts is where user input is
	                    required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                    In order to understand everything, let's just go through the entire workflow of submitting content.
