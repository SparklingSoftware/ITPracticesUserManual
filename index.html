                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the "IT Practices User Manual". This manual is part of the Global IT Community. </p>
                    <p>If you are reading a printed version, you can find the latest version online at <a href="http://usermanual.itpractices.org">http://usermanual.itpractices.org</a>. This version was taken from the website at:</p>
                    <div id="dateDiv" style="font-weight: bold"></div><p></p>
                    
                    <p>The tools, processes and other artefacts that make up "How the community works" are all driven by the community itself via a Continuous Improvement process. We are certainly drinking our own champagne!</p>
                    <p>Suggestions for improvements to "How the community works", this manual or any other improvement for that matter can be submitted in the <a href="http://jira.alm-community.org">Progress Tracking</a> tool. More information about this tool can be found <a href="#ProgressTracking">below</a></p>                    

                    <h2>What this manual is for</h2>
                    <p>This manual helps you find your way within the eco system of the IT Practices Community. It explains how the various systems integrate and how to use each.</p>
                    <p>If you are just getting involved in the community and just want to find out the basics you are able to glans over the topics and get the gist of what the community is about and why it's absolutely awesome! </p>
                    <p>The natural progression is to become an active member after a while and to start contributing to certain topics. That would be a good point in time to re-read this manual to understand in more detail what the processes are and what the expectations are in each contribution stage. We have found that this considerably improves the efficiency.</p>
                    <p>When you have tasted the easy and agility of making process improvements that this PII gives you, you will inevitably want to implement either the practices agreed in the community and/or the PII itself. That is also covert in this manual, even though it is only on a high level. The reason is that adopting these generic practices and transform them into Best Practices for you professional environment takes specific action plans.</p>
                    <p>Sparkling IT specialises in Implementing Best Practices and a Continuous Improvement Culture. More information can be found on our website.</p>

                    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
                    <p>Even though everyone should be able to read this document, the audience targeted in this manual are people who have significant experience in multiple IT disciplines. We will therefor make some assumptions about existing knowledge. The following table articulates these knowledge areas and where to find more information if need be.</p>

                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>The typical one-liner used to explain the community is: "To collaboratively create a WikiPedia for IT Practices", called the "IT Practices Library".</p>
                    <p>In more detail the vision of the entire community is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Determine best practices and recommendations for IT processes, practices and tools.</li>
                        <li>Provide working examples and artifacts to implement the recommendations.</li>
                        <li>Create a crowd-sourced1) community.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Allowing the broad discovery and leverage many experts' real life experience.</li>
                                <li>Validation of content by the global community.</li>
                                <li>Ability to maintain a large volume of content by utilizing many participants.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>To be a delegated authority for IT Best Practices for as many organisations as possible in the IT Industry.</li>
                        <li>Providing foundation for the rapid adoption of IT Best Practices within participating companies.</li>
                        <li>Allow participating organisations to contribute back to the community for wider adoption.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Benefits of participating</h2>
                    <p>
                        You will learn the Best IT Practices that will help you be more efficient in your role, what IT Best Practices would help your organisation as a whole be
                        more efficient and increase consistency. It will also open the doors for you to become a thought leader in the industry and allow you to set directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How? Well... What we are talking about is you gaining Tacit Knowledge of these IT Best Practices and being able to apply them. Gaining Tacit Knowledge is a
                        complicated way of saying "Learning". People Learn in a couple of ways:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tacit to Tacit</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tacit to Tacit knowledge transfer usually happens verbally, where one person knows stuff and explains it verbally to others. This happens during
                                presentations. Slides may be used, but presentations are primarily Tacit-to-Tacit.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Explicit to Tacit</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading a book or a WikiPedia page are examples of learning from explicit knowledge (Captured somewhere, paper in this case). The knowledge is captured
                                somewhere and is made available for everyone to absorb.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Personal Experience</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We all learn from Personal Experiences on a daily basis. In the professional sense, this means "Learning on the Job". This area is out of scope for the
                                community.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Why is this important?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, each approach has its pro's and con's. Tacit-to-Tacit has the benefit of being able to tailor the communication for the audience, but its labour
                        intensive and it therefore scales poorly. Explicit to Tacit has the downside of ambiguity while creating it and when learning from it and the content needs
                        to be maintained in order to remain fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Global IT Community uses the best of both ways of learning. Furthermore, it acknowledges shortcomings and risks and has implemented practices to
                        mitigate risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Monthly meetings in various cities across the globe help with the initial Tacit-to-Tacit knowledge. We capture the conversations as accurately as we can
                        and transform that into explicit knowledge for everyone to use (IT Practices Library). Please note that we not only summarize the outcomes, but also and
                        probably more importantly also the conversation leading up the decisions. We Capture the WHY behind the IT Practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This explicit knowledge provides us with a common language that then help us with the Tacit-to-Tacit knowledge transfer.
                    </p>                    


                    <h2>"IT Practices" versus "IT Best Practices"</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may have realised that we make a distinction between "IT Practices" and "IT Best Practices".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The difference is that the context matters when applying "IT Practices". Therefore, creating a single library that articulates "IT Best Practices" would
                        not be right. We have created a library that gives you all the facts you need to determine your "IT Best Practices", given the context that you will be
                        using them in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you accept that the Pareto Principle (80-20 rule) also applies, than most of the content should also be a best practice for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that, determining what Generic IT Practices are IT Best Practices for you does require in depth knowledge and experience. Sparkling IT, Founder
                        of the Global IT Community has over a decade of experience in implementing process improvements based on IT Best Practices and is able to help you
                        determine these in record time.

                    <h2>Not another standards library!!</h2>
                    <p>
                        You might be thinking: 'Not another one…' and you would be right. We feel the same way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Global IT Practices Communities approach has some fundamental differences compared to traditional frameworks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Crowd sourced, therefore more detailed guidance and fresh content.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similar to Wikipedia, which is also maintained by a large group of users, we believe the amount of content we can maintain is highly correlated to the
                                number of people participating. More people equals more detailed guidance. Traditional frameworks won't articulate "how" you should implement the
                                practices. This community takes the next step to do exactly that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Combining a crowd sourcing approach with a focus on revising existing content on a regular basis keeps it fresh. No more stale standards!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>

                            <p>
                                <strong>A technology platform that enables efficient sharing of IT Practices and improve collaboration on improvements.</strong>

                    <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>
                        The community consist of many groups and in order to make everyone collaborate efficiently, a hierarchy has emerged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most visible level is the "City" level as that's the level where the physical, public meetings happen. All companies are invited to join and
                        participate in the Monthly Afternoon meetings as well as attending the evening presentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A city community has multiple sub-groups, each with their own special interest. Topics like "Development", "Testing", "Methods", "Procurement",
                        "Configuration Management", etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each sub-group also elects a lead and a delegate. The lead (or the delegate) participate in an overarching forum called the SEPG. The purpose of this
                        overarching group is to formally approve changes to the <a href="http://todo">IT Practices library</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One can imagine that a need exists for communication across cities. And one is correct! The leads of the city SEPG collaborate in the country SEPG. And one
                        level further up, the country SEPG leads get together in the Global SEPG.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Until now, we've only spoken about the hierarchy up. But there is also communities feeding into the City communities. And those communities are within
                        organisations. Ideally, organisations would allow internal communities determine how employees in the organisation should work. That model work
                        particularly well in combination with the Global IT Practices Community as it prevents re-invention of wheel and a constant flow of fresh, community
                        approves content. No more stale standards!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The following diagram shows how the various communities relate:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Meetings</h2>
                    <p>
                        The city communities meet on a monthly basis. It's recommended to choose a time of month and a place and keep it consistent. I.e. Every first Wednesday of
                        the month, in the oval room of the White House. This makes it easier for people to remember of starts to build up a rhythm.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Membership</h2>
                    <p>
                        Participation is free and open for everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this doesn't mean there are no expectations on participating organisations. For the community to work we expect the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Respect the relevant <a href="http://www.itpractices.org/Live/contribute/charters">IT Practices Community Charters</a></li>
                        <li>Provide personal or organizational topics in the lead up to the meeting</li>
                        <li>Attend the community meetings and share your personal or organizational experiences.</li>
                        <li>Execute action items you volunteered for</li>
                        <li>Champion the adoption of the agreed IT Practices within your organization</li>
                        <li>At this stage, we exclude software vendors as regular members from the community as that might impact the perception of objectivity of the forum in regards
                        to discussions about tools.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Joining the community</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome! To join all you need to do is click on "Join" on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ALM-Melbourne-SEPG/">Global IT Practices Meetup</a>, fill
                        in the form and submit! Too easy…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to <a href="http://todo">suggest topics</a>, however we suggest you first attend a meeting to experience the vibe and to get a feel for the level
                        and type of conversations. That will also give you a chance to talk to the community lead in person and to discuss the best approach to become an active
                        member and how to champion the adoption of the IT Practices in your organisation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Suggest topics for discussion</h2>
                    <p>
                        You the participant choose the format and topics we will be discussing in the meetings. We match questions from organisations to answers that already exist
                        in other organisations and that these other organisations are happy to share.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three ways to suggest topics.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            1. Open up the <a href="http://todo">progress tracking tool</a> in the browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Go to the <a href="http://todo">IT Practices library</a> and in the bottom right corner you will find the option called <a>Improvement Proposal</a>.
                            This will open a form that allows you to specify some details of the topic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3. Emial the city community lead and he/she will take care of it for you. This approach does put you in debt with that particular person for a beverage of
                            his/her choice.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Once the topic is in the system, all participants can place votes on the topics and thereby indicating that you want to have this topic discussed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The City Community lead will, in the lead up to the meeting, create the agenda for the meeting. He/she will not only take into consideration the votes, but
                        also a fair distribution of benefits across the participating organisations. This way long term participation is encouraged.
